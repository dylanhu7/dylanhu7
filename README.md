### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineer at [World Labs](https://worldlabs.ai), where I'm building interfaces and interactions for spatial intelligence.

I recently graduated from Brown University, where I studied computer science and applied math.

I'm primarily interested in software engineering for interactive visual computing applications.

You can see more of my work at [dylan.hu](https://dylan.hu).

Say hi at hello@dylan.hu :)
